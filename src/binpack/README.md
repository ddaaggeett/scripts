## Automating Node.js Script Conversion to Executable

This guide explains how to automate the process of converting a Node.js script into an executable and adding it to your system's PATH. It includes a Node.js script that accepts the script's filename as a parameter and creates an executable shell script without the file extension.

### Summary

1. **Create the Node.js Script**:
   - Write your Node.js script and save it as `myapp.js`.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal and run the Node.js script `binpack.js` with your script file name as an argument:

     ```bash
     node binpack.js myapp.js
     ```

     This will create an executable shell script without the file extension in the current directory and then attempt to move it to `/usr/local/bin` (which may require superuser privileges).

3. **Use the Executable**:
   - After running the Node.js script, you can use your original script as a command. In this case, you can execute it by simply typing its name (without the file extension) in the terminal:

     ```bash
     myapp
     ```

     This command will run your Node.js script, `myapp.js`, as if it were a regular Linux executable.

By following these steps, you automate the process of converting your Node.js script into an executable and adding it to your system's PATH, making it accessible as a command.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a Node.js script named `myapp.js`, and you want to turn it into an executable command for convenient use. Follow these steps:

1. Save `myapp.js` in your working directory.

2. Open a terminal and run the `binpack.js` Node.js script with the following command:

   ```bash
   node binpack.js myapp.js
